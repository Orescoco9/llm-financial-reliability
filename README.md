# 💰 LLM Financial Risk Evaluation System

A local AI-powered system for evaluating financial risk using structured prompting, deterministic scoring, and automated evaluation of LLM outputs.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project explores how large language models behave in structured financial classification tasks. It uses a locally hosted LLM (via Ollama) to generate risk assessments from financial inputs and evaluates the consistency and reliability of its outputs.

The system focuses on **LLM reliability, structured output generation, and evaluation design**.

## ▶️ How to Run

 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Start local LLM (Ollama)
```bash
ollama run llama3.1

3. Run evaluation system
```bash
py src/run_tests.py

## 📊 Results

| Metric | Value |
|------|------|
| Accuracy | 80% – 100% (depending on dataset) |
| Model | Llama 3.1 (local via Ollama) |
| Evaluation Type | Rule-based + tolerance scoring |

### Key Findings

-LLM outputs vary on boundary conditions (e.g. debt_ratio = 0.7)
-Strict rule-based evaluation can misclassify borderline cases
-Model confidence does not always perfectly align with classification
-Evaluation design strongly impacts perceived model performance

💡 Why This Project Matters

Large Language Models can produce inconsistent outputs depending on prompt structure and edge cases.

This project demonstrates:

How to evaluate LLM reliability in structured tasks
How to design scoring systems for AI outputs
The gap between probabilistic reasoning and deterministic evaluation
Real-world challenges in AI system validation

This reflects core problems in AI engineering and LLM evaluation design.
